        <h1>Basic Info</h1>
        <h2>Spell System</h2>
        <p>Once spawning in, use the spell given to you to kill mobs like bandits and wind monkey's to gain experience. Once you reach level 5, find a Grimoire Tower and talk to the Wizard there. He will give you your grimoire. After you receive your grimoire, you will gain a new spell every 5 levels, with some attributes having more spells than others.</p>
